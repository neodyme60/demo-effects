This project will try to cover the basics of demo programming, by including all different kind of demo effects. Starting with the 
retro ones and ending with the latest techniques. 

The Demo Effects Collection uses the great mikmod library for playing musical mods. 
run configure --enable-mikmod=no if you don't want to use it. The Equalizer effect won't build in that case. 
The use of mikmod is enabled by default

For 3D collision detection and frustum culling, The Demo Effects Collection makes use of the excellent OPCODE 
collision detection library of Pierre Terdiman

If you don't want the 3D demonstrations, run configure --enable-opengl=no

The Demo Effects Collection is available under the GNU General Public License,
see the file "COPYING" for details.
